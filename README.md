# Industrial Wireless Channel Sounding-Error Calibration (IW-CSEC)
There are two methods to calibrate the CIR with system errors. One method is  channel sounding error calibration based on phase shifting (CSEC-Phase), another is channel sounding error calibration based on carrier frequency offset (CSEC-Frequency). Two types of system errors can be solved using this method. One error is sampling time deviation, another is phase shifting.
